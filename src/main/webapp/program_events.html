			<h2>How was this website built – Rebakure May 2015 Hackathon</h2>

			<p>On 30th may 2015, a  group of Rebakure members gathered in Oklahoma Christian University  campus to work on the Rebakure’s Website in a Hackathon dubbed Rebakure Hackathon. We established a live online platform where we exchanged expertise with people from Norman, it took the whole morning to develop both the website content and to build the website. Rebakure main objective is to create an environment where Rwandan living in Oklahoma will meet and share their daily social and professional life. The website will help people to access information and contribute to the overall success to the community.</p>
