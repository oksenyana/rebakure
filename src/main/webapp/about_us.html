				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<div class="large-7" style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:top; padding-right: 50px">
					<p>Rebakure Oklahoma is a not for profit community organization started in 2012 to create an environment for Rwandans, friends of Rwandans and friends of Rwanda to meet, connect, think and thrive through innovative programs and events. We work with other organizations and groups with shared interest to organize events and implement programs that stimulate the culture of sharing, entrepreneurship, leadership and solidarity.  Rebakure Oklahoma plans to organize events every year on the third week of every odd month which include an Annual Gala in November and a Summer Cook out in July and four workshops where speakers are invited and members speak about projects, initiatives and experiences.
